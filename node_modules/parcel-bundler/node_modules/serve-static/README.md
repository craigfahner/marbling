### serveStatic(root, options)

Create a new middleware function to serve files from within a given root
directory. The file to serve will be determined by combining `req.url`
with the provided root directory. When a file is not found, instead of
sending a 404 response, this module will instead call `next()` to move on
to the next middleware, allowing for stacking and fall-backs.

#### Options

##### acceptRanges

Enable or disable accept
