# sax js

A sax-style parser for XML and HTML.

Designed with [node](http://nodejs.org/) in mind, but should work fine in
the browser or other CommonJS implementations.

## What This Is

* A very simple tool to parse through an XML string.
* A stepping stone to a streaming HTML parser.
* A handy way to deal with RSS and other mostly-ok-but-kinda-broken XML
  docs.

## What This Is (probably) Not

* An HTML Parser - That's a fine goal, but this isn't it.  It's just
  XML.
* A DOM Builder - You can use it to build an object model out of XML,
  but it doesn't do that out of the box.
* XSLT - No DOM = no querying.
* 100% Compliant with (some other SAX implementation) - Most SAX
  implementations are in Java and do a lot more than this does.
* An XML Validator - It does a little validation when in strict mode, but
  not much.
* A Schema-Aware XSD Thing - Schemas are an exercise in fetishistic
  masochism.
* A DTD-aware Thing - Fetching DTDs is a much bigger job.

## Regarding `<!DOCTYPE`s and `<!ENTITY`s

The parser will handle the basic XML entities in text nodes and attribute
values: `&amp; &lt; &gt; &apos; &quot;`. It's possible to define additional
entities in XML by putting them in the DTD. This parser doesn't do anything
with that. If you want to listen to the `ondoctype` event, and then fetch
the doctypes, and read the entities and add them to `parser.ENTITIES`, then
be my guest.

Unknown entities will fail in strict mode, and in loose mode, will pass
through unmolested.

## Usage

```javascript
var sax = require("./lib/sax"),
  strict = true, // set to false for html-mode
  parser = sax.parser(strict);

parser.onerror = function (e) {
  // an error happened.
};
parser.ontext = function (t) {
  // got some text.  t is the string of text.
};
parser.onopentag = function (node) {
  // opened a tag.  node has "name" and "attributes"
};
parser.onattribute = function (attr) {
  // an attribute.  attr has "name" and "value"
};
parser.onend = function () {
  // parser stream is done, and ready to have more stuff written to it.
};

parser.write('<xml>Hello, <who name="world">world</who>!</xml>').close();

// stream usage
// takes the same options as the parser
var saxStream = require("sax").createStream(strict, options)
saxStream.on("error", function (e) {
  // unhandled errors will throw, since this is a proper node
  // event emitter.
  console.error("error!", e)
  // clear the error
  this._parser.error = null
  this._parser.resume()
})
saxStream.on("opentag", function (node) {
  // same object as above
})
// pipe is supported, and it's readable/writable
// same chunks coming in also go out.
fs.createReadStream("file.xml")
  .pipe(saxStream)
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream("file-copy.xml"))
```


## Arguments

Pass the following arguments to the parser function.  All are optional.

`strict` - Boolean. Whether or not to be a jerk. Default: `false`.

`opt` - Object bag of settings regarding string formatting.  All default to `false`.

Settings supported:

* `trim` - Boolean. Whether or not to trim text and comment nodes.
* `normalize` - Boolean. If true, then turn any whitespace into a single
  space.
* `lowercase` - Boolean. If true, then lowercase tag names and attribute names
  in loose mode, rather than uppercasing them.
* `xmlns` - Boolean. If true, then namespaces are supported.
* `position` - Boolean. If false, then don't track line/col/position.
* `strictEntities` - Boolean. If true, only parse [predefined XML
  entities](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-predefined-ent)
  (`&amp;`, `&apos;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, and `&quot;`)

## Methods

`write` - Write by
